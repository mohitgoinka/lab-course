CONCEPT USED:
An arduino is a very useful microcontroller. Therefore, it can be programmed via the Arduino language Processing to turn the 
LED on for a given interval of time and turn it off for a certain period of time. We can use it over and over again. To 
control the amount of time the LED will be on and the amount of time it will be off can easily be decided by our software code 
using the delay.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATION:
We learn that we can use aurduino to control several LEDs at once, and we can generate many patterns using the IDE. We observe 
that, as the code suggests, aurduino blinks the LED, that is, 500 ms off and 500 ms on.

PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
No problem faced while performing the experiment. Worked well, as the task was an easy one.

PRECAUTIONS:
1) Make sure all the connections are tight.
2) Connections should be neat and clean.
3) Make sure to use resistors, otherwise it may harm the LED.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
After performing this experiment, I am comfortable with the basic hardware and software aspects of Arduino.
