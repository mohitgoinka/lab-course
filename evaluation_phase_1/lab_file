CONCEPT USED:
An arduino is a very useful microcontroller. Therefore, it can be programmed via the Arduino language Processing to turn the 
LED on for a given interval of time and turn it off for a certain period of time. We can alse use ultrasonic sensors as well.
We can use it over and over again. To control the amount of time the LED will be on and the amount of time it will be off can 
easily be decided by our software code using the delay.

LEARNING AND OBSERVATION:
We learn that we can use aurduino to control several LEDs at once, and we can generate many patterns using the IDE. We observe 
that, as the code suggests, aurduino blinks the LED when the washing machine is filled with water, and the red LED turns on, 
when the washing machine is empty, that is, 20 ms off and 20 ms on.

PROBLEMS AND TROUBLESHOOTING:
No problem faced while performing the experiment. Worked well, and didn't face any problem.

PRECAUTIONS:
1) Make sure all the connections are tight.
2) Connections should be neat and clean.
3) Make sure to use resistors, otherwise it may harm the LED.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
After performing this experiment, I am comfortable with the some basic hardware and software aspects of Arduino.
