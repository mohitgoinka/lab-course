CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:

Uploaded as a different file.


CONCEPT USED:

1)By using kirchoff’s voltage law.
2)By using kirchoff’s current law.
3)Series and parallel connections.


LEARNING AND OBSERVATIONS: 

1)Connections in Breadboard and wiring. 
2)How to control arduino and its coding. 
3)Use of multimeter for continuity.


OBSERVATION: 

1)Blinking of leds in a pattern and in dual chasing form. 
2)Relation between software and hardware.


PROBLEMS & TROUBLESHOOTING: 

1)To select the right port and type of arduino.
2)To check the loose connections. 
3)To check the connections according to the codes.
4)To check the continuity of the circuit.
5)To check the flow of current in the circuit. 


PRECAUTIONS: 

1)Handle tools carefully.
2)Wear gloves.
3)Do not connect arduino till the circuit is complete.

 
OUTCOMES:

1)LEDs glows in a dual chasing pattern.
2)It can be used as for decorating purpose.
